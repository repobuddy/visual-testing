### Patch Changes

- [#156](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/156) [`72959a6`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/72959a6bd2bea3d9c1cff652b8ff384c10e017f2) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Add top level `types` field to `package.json` for project not using ESM module resolution.

- [#160](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/160) [`d2fdcbe`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/d2fdcbe023917ea9dc85ac332dfd8b46f6936f20) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Remove `expectToFail` from `VisOptions`.
  It should not have that property.

- [#161](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/161) [`43fc2ce`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/43fc2ce3385c0086de567816a1a1328ea4df336f) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Change default timeout to 30s.
  The initial timeout of 1s was set by Vitest.
  It is causing tests to fail with `TimeoutError`,
  even when getting `Locator` like `getByRole`.

  This timeout will be removed in Vitest 3.

  The underlying provider (`playwright`) does not have a default timeout.

  Setting to 30s should be a good default for most cases.

  It could still be too short for slow CI or when it is running scripts in parallel.
  That was the case for `storybook-test-runner` but could be improved in Vitest browser mode.

  If timeout is still an issue, we can further default it to 60s or even 120s.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#145](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/145) [`3ebc865`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/3ebc8655f3364a59de1d87930af53554dd9b4faa) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Fix `expectToFail` during snapshot update.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#139](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/139) [`17510d3`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/17510d32272730ebf4677ed2c4b177f636e75cc2) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Add `expectToFail` support.
  This is useful to test where the visual should be changed beyond the threshold.

- [#144](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/144) [`f642dbf`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/f642dbfbb6a715ef14a944c50e656b79c926b5d4) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Change `import { matchImageSnapshot } from 'vitest-plugin-vis/client'` to `import { imageSnapshotMatcher } from 'vitest-plugin-vis/client'`.

  This is a bug in 1.2.0 because `matchImageSnapshot` is hard loading `@vitest/browser/context`, which causes storybook to fail to load.

### Patch Changes

- [#144](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/144) [`2d4f1c0`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/2d4f1c02394ca4fd8880452a98399c825e686ee5) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Extends `expect` and `page` in presets.

  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "types": ["vitest-plugin-vis"]
    }
  }
  ```

  Add `stubBrowserCommandContext` to `/testing`.

  The plugin is not React specific.

- [#137](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/137) [`a3e3c89`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/a3e3c89341183a8ced5339290cc74d172b78f82d) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Update `writeImageSnapshot` signature.

- [#133](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/133) [`badf227`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/badf2273828ad883763e1e328b4e180c07b4960a) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Perform image comparison on the client side.
  This is similar to `storybook-addon-vis@0.13.0`, but the image taking is still done on the server side.

  Try to address the issue of the slower image comparison on the server side.

  Export `matchImageSnapshot` function on the client side.
  Mark `parseImageSnapshotSubject` as deprecated as it is not needed anymore.

### Patch Changes

- [#136](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/136) [`176d28f`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/176d28fc459cb0823f3fda94ad4e3372690dbd8d) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Update error message during threshold conversion.

## 1.0.5

### Patch Changes

- [#130](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/130) [`e242444`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/e242444908766274014b5fc94afaf31392627c88) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Add update snapshot back to the server implementation.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- [#125](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/pull/125) [`1068941`](https://github.com/repobuddy/storybook-addon-vis/commit/1068941b1495966cb3ee15a53dd5937e37365373) Thanks [@unional](https://github.com/unional)! - Try to improve the performance of the plugin by skipping the rescale step and not checking the CRC of the image.

  This should be safe because the image is generated by the browser, or it is a base64 string (not 100% sure on this), and the CRC is not used for anything.

  If not performance improvement is seen, we can revert this change.
